## Products

### MDF & HDF

MDF boards are generally denser than plywood. Made up of separated fibers, they can be used as a building material similar to plywood. MDF is stronger and much denser than particle board.

### WPC Board

Neom WPC is a 0.7 density board manufactured with state-of-the-art European machineries. It incorporates European technology and uses high-quality raw materials to ensure good strength that lasts a lifetime.

### Particle Board

Particle board, also known as particleboard, low-density fiberboard (LDF), and chipboard, is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, sawmill shavings, or sawdust. It uses a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, pressed and extruded.
